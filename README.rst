SimpleTimeTracker

SimpleTimeTracker is a light-weight command-line Python application that lets you track the time of your activities, like work or study for example.
It's really simple to use, it's divided in Projects and Sessions.
For every project you can have all the work/study sessions you want and at the end you could export a summary of the time spent. In case of work you can also enter your price per hour when export to calculate the money you have to ask for your project.

To open the application, simply type: "python stt.py"
